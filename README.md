## Overview

This repository provides a Laravel-based project (or any other framework you might be using) that manages entities such as projects, states, users, and roles. The schema is designed to handle the following:

- **Projects** that have deadlines, descriptions, and states.  
- **States** that define different statuses for a project (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed", etc.).  
- **Users** with specific **roles** (e.g., Admin, Manager, etc.).  
- A **project_states** table (pivot or history table) that links projects and states if you need to track project state changes over time.

| description | text         | Detailed description of the project |
| deadline    | datetime     | Deadline for the project            |
